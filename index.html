                            In this project, I will provide a rebuttal to the expressionist position as laid out in &quot;Music and Language&quot; by Steven Feld and Aaron A. Fox. The expressionist position says that &quot;music communicates (whether syntactically or referentially) within the domain of human emotion, by contrast with language’s capacity to communicate about conceptualization&quot; (Feld &amp; Fox). This definition narrowly confines the communicative abilities of both language and music. I will provide a series of examples that blur the line between language and music and show that music can communicate about conceptualization and language can communicate within the domain of human emotion.

                            The balafon is a type of xylophone that is commonly played in many West African countries. Laura McPherson did a study on it, collecting data from the balafonist Mamadou Diabat&eacute;. Diabat&eacute; is a professional balafon player, and you can see one of his performances on the left. The Sambla people use the balafon as a musical instrument, much like we use the xylophone. However, the balafon&apos;s notes and rhythms also have another purpose: they can serve as a musical surrogate language (McPherson). This type of language encodes a linguistic message into a non-linguistic modality. Go to the next slide to read more about how the balafon contradicts the expressionist position.

                            The balafon is a musical instrument, and the Sambla people also use it for linguistic communication. The balafon&apos;s surrogate language can encode the same linguistic messages that the Sambla people&apos;s language can. In McPherson&apos;s study, she found that the language of the balafon has a grammar that&apos;s different from the grammar of the spoken language (McPherson). It is not just an extension of the spoken language, there is a different system in place. But, like the spoken language, it can communicate about conceptualization and talk about everything that the spoken language can. To see examples of spoken phrases translated into the balafon, watch the video to the left.

                        The sounds from a balafon form a language that can be interpreted linguistically. However, the Sambla people also use the balafon as a musical instrument. Whenever the balafon is played, it could be perceived as either music or language (or a combination of those that transcends our narrow definitions of music and language). In this way, the &apos;music&apos; from the balafon can communicate about conceptualization, and the &apos;language&apos; from the balafon can communicate directly with the emotions. The balafon provides a nice counterexample to the expressionist argument and shows that the expressionist argument constricts what music and language too narrowly.

                            The Sabar is a type of drum that is popular is Senegal and Gambia. It is similar to the balafon in that it can be used as both a musical instrument and as a communicative language at the same time. It also has its own distinct grammar from the spoken language. In fact, there are many different linguistic varieties of Sabar, &quot;with lexicons and productive grammars of their own&quot; (Winter). Yoad Winter, who studies Sabar argues that &quot;despite their language-like forms, however, the main communicative function of Sabar rhythms is to affect the hearers rather than to efficiently convey propositions&quot; (Winter). He goes on to say that the musical qualities of the Sabar outweigh the linguistic ones, so when the Sabar is being used to convey a linguistic message, the message is still musical (Winter). Sabar is a language, but it is communicated in a musical way; it can communicate about conceptualization while still being music.

                <h2>Memorization in Qur&apos;anic Schools</h2>
                <div class="onecolumn">

                            In Northern Cameroon, students in Qur&apos;anic schools recite verses from the Qur&apos;an without knowing the meaning of the words they are saying. Their school teaches them to focus on other qualities of language besides meaning, such as pronunciation. The focus is on memorizing the words and the sounds instead of the meanings, because they are learning Arabic in a religious context and not a conversational one (Moore).
                        </p>
                        <p class="slidep2" id="slide4p2">
                            While Arabic can definitely be used to communicate about conceptualization, in this context it does not. Unlike what the expressionist argument states, the language is not being used to communicate about conceptualization. The students themselves do not know the meaning of the words they are reciting. However, they do know the context surrounding the text (when to say it, what the purpose is, etc.) and the emotional component resulting from that. This is the same as any piece of text holding any emotional meaning, except that these students do not have any other meaning to hold onto. The emotional component is what&apos;s left when the meaning is taken away, so the texts that the students have to memorize only have an emotional significance. When the students recite these Qur&apos;anic verses, the Arabic that they speak does not communicate about conceptualization. It can, however, communicate more directly with human emotions because the students understand the emotional and cultural significance behind the text and cannot only focus on the meaning.

                <h2>The Vocal Modality</h2>
                <div class="toptext" id="slide5toptext">

                            The vocal modality is the part of linguistic communication that involves speech. This includes the words that come out of a person&apos;s mouth as well as the intonation and tone of those words. The specific words that are used and the order they are in tend to reflect the concepts of the message. But the intonation is also important, and it can communicate directly to the emotions.

                    <p class="slidep2" id="slide5p2">
                        For example, in the image above, there are two components to the message (analogous to spoken speech): the words and the tone. The tone is communicated through the capitalization of the letters, and it corresponds to verbal sarcasm. When a person interprets this meme, they interpret the words conceptually and the tone emotionally. The expressionist position says that language communicates about conceptualization and not within the domain of human emotion, but when a speaker is sarcastic, the listener does not interpret the tone as a concept. Instead, the listener reacts emotionally from the tone that the speaker uses.

                            The visuospatial modality is comprised of manual gestures, facial expressions, and body posture. It includes many non-verbal aspects of linguistic messages that are important in communicating the intended meaning. Similar to the vocal modality, some aspects of the visuospatial modality communicate more directly with the emotions than with conceptualization (Stivers &amp; Sidnell).
                        </p>

                    <p class="slidep2" id="slide6p2">
                        For example, the person in the picture above is clearly communicating their current state of mind. This is a linguistic message communicated through the visuospatial modality. When someone sees body language like this, the meaning is interpreted emotionally instead of conceptually. The language in this case goes against the expressionist position, as it is language that relates directly with the emotions.

                    <p>
                        The expressionist position is a crude one, oversimplifying the relationship between music and language and emotions and concepts. The communicative ability of both music and language is not limited in this way. Music has the ability to communicate concepts, and language has the ability to communicate with human emotions. In fact, there is no clear distinction between what counts as music and what counts as language. The examples in this slideshow show that the concepts of music and language are not limited to the narrow viewpoint of the expressionist argument.
